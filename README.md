These are two of my very first projects I did during my bachelor's.

#esnlyrics

It's a static website containing some lyrics. There is no theme or template. The whole project is written in raw html and css. I did this for my course Project 200.

#Uronchondi
Uronchondi is basically a tourist helper website where the information about different places are displayed. 
I made this website for my Project 300 course. It's also a static website containing raw html, css and a little bit javascript.
